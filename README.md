# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Netflix Data Analysis project repository! This project focuses on gaining valuable insights from the Netflix dataset obtained from 'kaggle.com'. The repository includes the processed data, analysis scripts, and an interactive Power BI dashboard for effective visualization.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Acquisition
We obtained the Netflix dataset from 'kaggle.com,' providing a diverse range of information for our analysis. The raw data is available in the 'data' directory.

### 2. Data Cleaning
Ensuring data quality is paramount, and to achieve this, we performed thorough data cleaning using Excel. The cleaned dataset can be found in the 'cleaned_data' directory, showcasing improved reliability for analysis.

### 3. Power BI Dashboard
To provide a user-friendly interface for exploring the data insights, we developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The 'dashboard' directory contains the necessary files for visualization. Feel free to explore and interact with the dashboard to uncover trends and patterns.
